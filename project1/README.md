## Abstract

Endurance exercise performance is degraded with increasing environmental temperature, and the decline in performance associated with warmer temperatures is magnified with longer-distance events such a the marathon footrace (42.2k). In addition, older adults experience thermoregulatory challenges that impair their ability to dissipate heat, which can further exacerbate the impact of warmer temperatures. Finally, there are well-documented sex differences in endurance performance and in physiological processes related to thermoregulation. We find that completion time varies significantly by age, following a non-linear trend. Although the performance quartiles are relatively stable across flag conditions, there is a significant correlation between the weather variables. All in all, we find that solar radiation, relative humidity, and wet bulb globe temperature are the most significant predictors of completion time.

## Key Findings 

- Completion time follows a linear, then quadratic trend, also across gender
