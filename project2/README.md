## Abstract

In this project, we investigate potential mediators of smoking cessation amongst adults experiencing major depressive disorder. We consider a 2x2 factorial design comparing behavioral activation for smoking cessation (BASC) to standard behavioral treatment (ST); as well as varenicline versus placebo. We find that while FTCD score is the only significant predictor (at $\alpha = 0.05$) of smoking cessation, smoking cessation is significantly mediated by the black race indicator. Moreover, there is slight evidence around the mediation of age, the use of antidepression medication, and a measure of the perceived reward of cigarettes. 

## Key Findings 

- We find evidence of mediation by black race and address the colliding path with an IV approach using menthol cigarette use

- We find that smoking cessation is significantly mediated by black race, and moderately by age, the use of antidepression medication, and a measure of the perceived reward of cigarettes
